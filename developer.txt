# developer.txt – INSPIRE HOROSCOPE & BIRTH CHART PORTAL (MVP)

## High-level Goal

Build a **web-based horoscope + simple birth chart portal** themed around INSPIRE.

This is an MVP:
- It does *not* need full professional-level astrology accuracy with complex ephemeris libraries.
- It DOES need:
  - A polished, interactive UI where users enter their birth info.
  - A dynamically generated profile:
    - Sun sign (always).
    - Optional “mood” sections based on elements (Fire/Earth/Air/Water) and modalities (Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable).
    - INSPIRE-flavored interpretations (rebellious, creative, streetwise).
  - A daily-style horoscope generator that feels unique and “personal.”

Tech: vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript; 3-file static site that I can embed into Shopify.

## Brand / Vibe

- Name: **INSPIRE COSMIC BLUEPRINT**
- Tone: Neo-Native / hacker mystic / city shaman.
- Feel: Tech x nature x resistance x self-mastery.
- Not cringe or overpromise; more like insightful coaching through an esoteric lens.
- Use emojis lightly (e.g., 🐺🔥🌙⚡) but keep it clean.

## Tech Stack & Deliverables

Same structure as the 8-ball project:

1. `index.html`
2. `styles.css`
3. `script.js`

No framework, no build step, no backend.

Optional: Google Fonts.

## Embedding Requirements

Like before, design as a self-contained widget/page:

- Root container: `<div id="inspire-horoscope-app">…</div>`
- Prefix classes/IDs with `inspire-horoscope-` to avoid collisions.
- Wrap JS in `DOMContentLoaded` and avoid leaking globals.
- Provide brief comment in `index.html` with embedding instructions for Shopify and for standalone hosting.

## User Flow

1. **Landing State**
   - Title: “INSPIRE COSMIC BLUEPRINT”
   - Short subtext: “Drop your birth data. We’ll sketch your cosmic operating system.”
   - A subtle “for entertainment / art purposes” disclaimer.

2. **Input Form**
   - Fields:
     - Name or nickname (optional, used only in display).
     - Date of birth (day, month, year) – required.
     - Time of birth (optional) – can be HH:MM with AM/PM, or 24h.
     - Place of birth (optional text) – used as flavor only, not for precise calcs at MVP stage.
   - A “Generate My Blueprint” button.

3. **Result View (Profile)**
   After submission, show on the same page (no reload):

   a) **Core Identity Panel**
      - Display:
        - Sun sign (based on DOB).
        - Element (Fire/Earth/Air/Water).
        - Modality (Cardinal/Fixed/Mutable).
      - Each with a small INSPIRE-flavored blurb.

   b) **INSPIRE Archetype**
      - Based on Sun sign (and optionally element), map the user to an archetype:
        - Examples (you can refine names and mapping):
          - Aries: “The Shock Trooper”
          - Taurus: “The Builder”
          - Gemini: “The Signal Jammer”
          - Cancer: “The Memory Keeper”
          - Leo: “The Beacon”
          - Virgo: “The Systems Analyst”
          - Libra: “The Diplomat”
          - Scorpio: “The Shadow Operative”
          - Sagittarius: “The Scout”
          - Capricorn: “The Architect”
          - Aquarius: “The Hacker”
          - Pisces: “The Dream Diver”
      - Each archetype gets:
        - A short **Core Directive** paragraph.
        - A **Shadow Pattern** paragraph (what trips them up).
        - A **Upgrade Path** paragraph (how to evolve).

   c) **Daily / Session Horoscope**
      - Generate a “today-style” horoscope on button click.
      - It does NOT have to be API-driven. Implement a pseudo-AI text generator using:
        - A small library of sentence fragments.
        - Element + modality + archetype tags.
        - Current date (just for seeding/pseudo-randomness) so it doesn’t change constantly on refresh within the same day.
      - Logic example:
        - Pick a base template for the element (e.g., Fire → “lean into action / courage / risk”; Earth → “stability / body / money”; etc.).
        - Add a line referencing archetype’s Shadow Pattern (“Watch out for your default move: X”).
        - Add one actionable line (“Try [X] in the next 24 hours.”).
      - This should feel cohesive, not just random fragments thrown together.

   d) **Mini “Birth Chart” Wheel (Simplified)**
      - For MVP, it’s fine to:
        - Show a simple circular graphic divided into 12 zodiac segments.
        - Highlight the Sun sign segment.
      - Implementation:
        - Use CSS or SVG; no need for precise angles beyond sign division.
      - Optionally display a short note: “Full chart (Moon, Rising, houses) coming in a future upgrade.”

4. **Edit / Regenerate**
   - Include a “Change Info” button to re-open the form (or keep form visible above).
   - Include a “Regenerate Today’s Download” button that uses a different variation while still tagging the same sign/element.

## Astrology Logic (MVP-Level)

You can hard-code the zodiac sign by date ranges:

- Aries: March 21 – April 19
- Taurus: April 20 – May 20
- Gemini: May 21 – June 20
- Cancer: June 21 – July 22
- Leo: July 23 – August 22
- Virgo: August 23 – September 22
- Libra: September 23 – October 22
- Scorpio: October 23 – November 21
- Sagittarius: November 22 – December 21
- Capricorn: December 22 – January 19
- Aquarius: January 20 – February 18
- Pisces: February 19 – March 20

Elements:
- Fire: Aries, Leo, Sagittarius
- Earth: Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn
- Air: Gemini, Libra, Aquarius
- Water: Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces

Modalities:
- Cardinal: Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn
- Fixed: Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius
- Mutable: Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces

All of this logic should live in `script.js` in clean, well-commented structures so I can easily tweak text later.

## Layout & UI Requirements

- **Mobile-first**:
  - Single column layout, top-down: form → profile → horoscope → mini chart.
- **Desktop**:
  - Max-width container (e.g., 900–1000px).
  - Could be two-column for profile + horoscope side-by-side.
- Sections:
  - Distinct cards or panels (with drop shadows and subtle glows).
- Visual Style:
  - Dark background with cosmic gradient accents.
  - Use accent color for the Sun sign and archetype title.
- Animations:
  - Simple fade-in for the results after form submit.
  - No heavy/complex animations that hurt performance.

## Code Organization

**index.html**
- Root container `#inspire-horoscope-app`.
- Top header with title and subtitle.
- Form section.
- Results container (initially hidden).
- Within results:
  - Identity panel.
  - Archetype panel.
  - Horoscope panel.
  - Chart panel.

**styles.css**
- All styles scoped with `#inspire-horoscope-app` or `.inspire-horoscope-*`.
- Define:
  - Typography (use a Google Font for headings and a clean font for body).
  - Cards, borders, spacing, responsive behavior (via media queries).
  - Subtle gradients for headers.
  - Highlight styles for archetype name and Sun sign.

**script.js**
- On `DOMContentLoaded`, wire everything:
  1. Parse form input, validate DOB fields.
  2. Convert date to JS Date object and determine Sun sign from date ranges.
  3. Map sign → element, modality, archetype.
  4. Build the profile object, e.g.:

     ```js
     const profile = {
       name,
       sunSign,
       element,
       modality,
       archetype,
       elementText,
       modalityText,
       coreDirective,
       shadowPattern,
       upgradePath
     };
     ```

  5. Render profile into DOM.
  6. Generate horoscope text with a function like `generateHoroscope(profile, currentDate)`.
     - Use deterministic seeding (e.g., combine sign + date) when possible so the user doesn’t get a wildly different reading on each reload the same day.
  7. Render the mini chart highlighting the sign.
  8. Provide a “Regenerate” button that calls `generateHoroscope` again with a slightly different random seed (but still on-theme).

- Keep the text dictionaries and narrative content in clearly labeled editable sections at the top or bottom of the file with comments: `// === EDITABLE TEXT: START ===`.

## Disclaimers & Footer

Include at bottom:
- A subtle line: “✨ This is an art & storytelling project, not professional advice. Trust yourself first.”
- A small `#teamINSPIRE` tag.

## Documentation Request

At the end of your answer, please:
- Explain how to:
  - Run the app locally.
  - Host as static files.
  - Embed it in Shopify (iframe or inline).
- Highlight where I can easily tweak:
  - Archetype names and text.
  - Sign interpretations.
  - Horoscope flavor text and sentence fragments.
  - Colors and fonts.
